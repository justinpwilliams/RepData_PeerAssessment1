Personal Activity Monitoring Analysis: Reproducible Research Project 1
========================================================
# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1
```{r setoptions, echo = FALSE}
opts_chunks$set(echo = TRUE)
```
This is an analysis of data from personal activity monitoring devices. It is being
completed as project for the Reproducible Research course offered by Johns
Hopkins through Coursera.

## Loading and preprocessing the data
The source data is stored as a zip file at 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip

We will download the file to the "data" directory, unzip the file, and store the 
contained csv as a data frame.
```{r loadingData, echo=TRUE}
url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(url, "data/activity.zip", method = "curl")
unzip("data/activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

We need to transform the "date" field to be represented as a date for later in
the analysis.
```{r transformingDate}
activity$date <- as.POSIXct(activity$date)
```

Also, we will transform the "interval" variable to a factor for analysis.
```{r transformInterval}
activity$interval <- as.factor(activity$interval)
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
For this part, we will ignore missing values, and reconsider them later.

To compute summary statistics based on total steps by day, let's create a data 
frame that contains the sum of all steps by day.
```{r sumByDay}
sums <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, sum)
```

Now we'll generate a histogram of those sums. I prefer the aesthetics of ggplot2
, so we will load that library.
```{r histogramTotalStepsByDay}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(sums$steps) + xlab("Sum of steps by day")
```

Now let's find the mean and median of the sum of steps by day.
```{r meanandmedian}
dailymean <- mean(sums$steps)
dailymedian <- median(sums$steps)
```

The mean of total steps per day is `r dailymean` and the median is `r dailymedian`.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
Let's see how steps vary over the time intervals by day.
```{r plotOfStepsByInterval}
ggplot(meansByInt, aes(as.integer(interval),steps)) + geom_line()
```

From the time series it appears that the

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
